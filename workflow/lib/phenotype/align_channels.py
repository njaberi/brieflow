"""Module for aligning channels in phenotype.

Uses NumPy and scikit-image to provide image
alignment between sequencing cycles, apply percentile-based filtering, fill masked
areas with noise, and perform various transformations to enhance image data quality.

    """Rigid alignment of phenotype channels based on target and source channels.

    Args:
        image_data (np.ndarray): The input data containing the channels with dimensions
            (STACK, CHANNEL, I, J) if stacked, or (CHANNEL, I, J) if not.
        target (int): Index of the channel that other channels will be aligned to.
        (NNJP changed) source (list): Indices of the channels to align with the target. 
        (NNJP changed) riders (dictionary, optional): Channel indices that should follow
            the same alignment each the source channel {source:[listofriders]}. Defaults to {}.
        upsample_factor (int, optional): Subpixel alignment is done if greater than one.
            Defaults to 2.
        window (int, optional): A centered subset of data is used if greater than one.
            Defaults to 2.
        remove_channel (str or bool, optional): Specifies whether to remove channels after alignment.
            Options are {'target', 'source', False}. Defaults to False.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: Phenotype data aligned across specified channels.
