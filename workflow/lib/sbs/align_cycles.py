    Args:
        image_data (np.ndarray or list of np.ndarray): Unaligned SBS image with dimensions
            (CYCLE, CHANNEL, I, J) or list of single cycle SBS images, each with dimensions
            (CHANNEL, I, J).
        channel_order (list[str], optional): List of channel names in the order they are acquired.
            Example: ["DAPI", "G", "T", "A", "C"]. If None, will assume first channel is DAPI
            and remaining are bases. Defaults to None.
        method (str, optional): Method to use for alignment. Options are {'DAPI', 'sbs_mean'}.
            If None, will automatically select based on available channels. Defaults to None.
        upsample_factor (int, optional): Subpixel alignment is done if greater than one
            (can be slow). Defaults to 2.
        window (int or float, optional): A centered subset of data is used if greater than one.
            Defaults to 2.
        cutoff (int or float, optional): Cutoff for normalized data to help deal with noise in
            images. Defaults to 1.
        q_norm (int, optional): Quantile for normalization to help deal with noise in images.
            Defaults to 70.
        use_align_within_cycle (bool, optional): Align SBS channels within cycles. Defaults to True.
        skip_cycles (list[int] or None, optional): List of cycle indices to skip (0-based).
            These cycles will be completely excluded from alignment. Defaults to None.
        manual_background_cycle (int or None, optional): Specific cycle to use for
            background channel (0-based). Must be specified by user if needed.
            Defaults to None. If not specified, and extra channels are present,
            the cycle with the most extra channels will be used as the source for
            propagating extra channels across cycles. Only used if shapes vary across cycles.
        manual_channel_mapping (list or None, optional): List of channel orders for each cycle.
            Each element should be a list of channel names in the order they appear in that cycle's data.
            If provided, this will override automatic channel detection and enable smart channel filling.
            Example: [["DAPI", "G", "T", "A", "C"], ["DAPI", "G", "T", "A", "C"], ["DAPI", "GFP", "G", "T", "A", "C", "AF750"]]
            for a 3-cycle dataset where the third cycle has additional GFP and AF750 channels.
            Defaults to None.
