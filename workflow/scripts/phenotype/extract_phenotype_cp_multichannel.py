    # TO-DO: Ensure conda environment is set up for cp_measure when using this method.
    # A quick guide:
    # 1. Clone brieflow environment:
    #    conda create --name brieflow_cpmeasure_env --clone brieflow_main_env
    # 2. Activate the environment:
    #    conda activate brieflow_cpmeasure_env
    # 3. Install the required package:
    #    pip install cp-measure
    # 4. Verify dependencies with 'conda list'- Cpmeasure requires Python 3.8 or later, and the following package versions:
    #    - NumPy 1.24.3*
    #    - centrosome 1.3.0*
    #    If you have issues running cpmeasure, you may need to downgrade these packages in the cloned environment.
